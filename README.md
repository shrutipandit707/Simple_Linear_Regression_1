# Advertising Case Study for Simple Linear Regression
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Simple Linear Regression techniques. We will be understanding and solving an advertising problem in Marketing Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like advertising prediction system.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Simple Linear Regression Techniques for Marketing Domain.

- What is the background of your project?

We will use the marketing data set included which contains the advertising budgets (in US dollars) for various media (Radio, TV and newspapers) of a fictional company and sales data for that company.

- Business Problem Statement:

We want to develop a Simple Linear Regression model to explain the relationship between the predictor variables and the numeric response variable sales. 

- What is the dataset that is being used?

We got the dataset from Upgrad.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- To summarise, we have performed a Simple Linear Regression and have covered some basic introductory statistics as well. This is by no means a comprehensive analysis of the marketing data set but simply an example of how to perform and interpret a Simple Linear Regression with Python. Itâ€™s a good starting point, especially when attempting to understand the relevance of important statistical concepts like t-statistic, p-value and standard error.
